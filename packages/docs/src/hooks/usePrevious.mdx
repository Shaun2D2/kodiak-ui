# usePrevious

React state hook for getting the value of the previous state. This follows the approach that
the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-get-the-previous-props-or-state) recommends.

```ts
import * as React from 'react'
import { usePrevious } from '@skyverge/tackle-box'

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const prevCount = usePrevious<number>(count)

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={setCount(count + 1)}>
      Increase count
    </button>
  )
}
```
