# Overview

üëã Another component library?! Yep, but let us assure you that this one is different. Kodiak's
components provide a composible and themable approach to building applications.

We, at SkyVerge, needed a set of components and hooks that could be shared across multiple applications and products that have extremely
different designs and systems. We were frustrated with a lot of third party component libraries and how difficult they are to
overwrite or customize for different apps until we found Styled System and Theme UI.

We decided to create shared components built on top of the Styled System props and the Theme UI themeing system to provide
building blocks and extensible components without locking developers into a specific look and feel.

## üôè Influences

We are building on top of the shoulders of the smart developers of Theme UI, Styled System, Emotion, Tachyons, and Tailwind.
