Kodiak UI is a performant and accessible hook and component library for React built by the team at [SkyVerge](https://skyverge.com). Kodiak aims to provide all of the necessary building blocks to create fully accessible and performant applications without having to overwrite a lot of pre-determined defaults or styling that other component libraries are shipped with.
