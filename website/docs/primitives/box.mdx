`Box` is the most basic building block to Kodiak UI. By default it will render a `div` and is the component that you should use whenever adding structural elements to your application.

`Box` can be rendered as any other structural element by passing in the `as` prop.

```tsx
<Box as="main">I'm rendered in a `main` element</Box>
```
