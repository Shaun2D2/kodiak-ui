```tsx
<Flex sx={{ alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <Box p={2} bg="primary" sx={{ flex: '1 1 auto' }}>
    Flex
  </Box>
  <Box p={2} bg="muted">
    Box
  </Box>
</Flex>
```

`Flex` is the same thing as `Box` except that `display: flex` is set by default. `Flex` accepts the `sx`
prop as well as all flexbox properties.
