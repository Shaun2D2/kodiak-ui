```tsx
<Grid sx={{ gridGap: 4, gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 1fr' }}>
  <Box p={2} bg="primary" sx={{ flex: '1 1 auto' }}>
    CSS
  </Box>
  <Box p={2} bg="muted">
    Grid
  </Box>
</Grid>
```

`Grid` is the same thing as `Box` except that `display: grid` is set by default. `Grid` accepts the `sx`
prop as well as all CSS Grid properties.
